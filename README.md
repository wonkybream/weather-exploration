## Exploring weather data

I have downloaded all the available data from my local weather station _Liperi Tuiskavanluoto_, I can actually see it from my window.

Data is provided by the [Finnish Meteorogical Institute â€“ Download observations](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/download-observations) service.

My goal is to:

* Get familiar with weather data
* Have a better intuition on [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/) internals
* Have a better intuition on [Polars DataFrames](https://pola.rs/) library
* Hopefully uncover some interesting things from this data

Here's the [open-data-license](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-data-licence) used by the Finnish Meteorogical Institution.
